In my approach to districts.py, I essentially programmed the methods individually (only paying attention to their place in the program as a whole when creating the histogram) since their functions were each fairly straightforward. For lm.py, context was hugely important just to understand the purpose of the pre-coded data structure (self._vocab) and the need for another data structure (self._counts) to allow all the necessary functionality. As such, I read all the given code for the BigramLanguageModel class before going to work on its functions.

In general, Colorado's congressional districts look more like disctricts which Obama won, as their log probabilities show most districts--excepting districts 4 and 5, 4 being very rural and 5 containing several large military institutions including NORAD and the Air Force Academy--having a log probability closer to 0 for Obama, indicating their general election values to be closer to a given variance about the mean of states won by Obama.

Assuming my histogram (attempting to directly show general election distribution of every state) is correct, it is unreasonable to assume a normal distribution for the Republican vote. This is likely due to the higher polarization of districts (as opposed to states) as a result of higher variances from a smaller section of population, "clumping" of similar views due to the particular grouping of districts (rural vs urban and so on), and potential side effects of gerrymandering from both sides.

Word said by Obama and no previous president: “antsy”
It's hard to imagine a president using this word in an official context.
Bigram______________________________________: “eighth year”
This seems like a bizarrely common phrase for none of the tested presidents to have said in their State of the Union speeches, but my vocab generation seems to be working fine.
