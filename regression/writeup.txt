The largest change I made to the given code is likely the switch to a polynomial model, which was carried out on intuition and justified by results. As election maps typically show many invariably red and blue states (such as Nebraska and California) with only a few consistent "purple" states such as Colorado and Ohio. As such, the vote distribution seems better fit to a curve than a line, and the calculated RMSE--given when dividing the 2012 data into 40 train and 11 test states--was in fact more than halved when switching from a linear to a polynomial model with all features in place (from approx. 5.382 to 2.388). After switching to the polynomial model, I chose to normalize based on the hugely variable ranges of the various feature data, and this too improved on the model accuracy to a large degree. 

While training is clearly quite significant to the creation of a model, I was more focused on adding features to the model than additional polling data, purely because using correlations to improve model accuracy is more interesting to me personally than producing a definitive polling average. However, I did add separate aggregate poll data from http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2012/Info/data.html for the train set and http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2016/Info/data.html for the test set (though the .csv files in question look different from each other as, the 2016 .csv download being an empty file, I had to instead format the ASCII download to a .csv to get data from the same source). This did seem to increase the accuracy pretty significantly, at least insofar as decreasing Hillary's predicted electoral vote share to 329 (still quite high compared to my own expectations and the predictions of, among others, Nate Silver's model).

In considering features, I selected factors that I knew to be most highly correlated to party leanings. Though I came up with a fairly long list, between lack of proper or accurate data for certain potential features (such as foreign food consumption per this article: http://time.com/4400706/republican-democrat-foods/) and features which actually decreased the accuracy of my model (car ownership, state debt, etc.), the only features which now remain are the fairly obvious ones: population density, average education (measured by the percentage of the population with advanced degrees), state average income tax, and African-American population.

All data in the final model version was pulled from the following sites, which were searched for in the process of feature engineering and chosen due to the apparent accuracy and verifiability of the data presented, or, in the case of wikipedia, that of the data presented by the sources linked to within the article:
